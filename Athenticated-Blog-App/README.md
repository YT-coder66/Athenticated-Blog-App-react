## How It Works

- Users can register and login; authentication status is stored in React Context and localStorage.

- Private routes guard dashboard and post management pages.

- Blog posts are saved in localStorage to simulate persistent data.

- Users can create, edit, and delete posts.

- A loading spinner appears during async operations.

- The navbar updates based on authentication state, offering intuitive navigation.

- Responsive design ensures usability on all screen sizes.
